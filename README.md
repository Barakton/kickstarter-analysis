# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise visualize and analyze how other Kickstarters fared compared to her own play and Kickstarter, Fever.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking at the pivot chart and table I created, in relation to outcomes and Months, I came to the conclusion that there were alot of success rates in the months of May and June. From there they began to taper off.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the outcomes based on the monetary goal set for each Kickstarter, graph I created shows that as you go past the $5000 mark, success rates begin to plummet. They begin to rise again near the $35000 - $44999 range but there are fewer projects in that price range, so that may be an outlier.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most difficult part I encountered was creating the COUNTIFS(). Making the range between the monetary goals was confusing at first but I was able to figure it out and have it output the correct results.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) A good Launch Date for Kickstarters that are based around Theater is between May and July. 
2) The Success and Failure rate increase and decrease with each other. It isn't by a huge margin but you can see the similarities.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The Key point from the Outcomes based on Goals is that if you can request between 0 and 5000 you will have the highest success rate.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset doesn't provide anything bases on tier rewards for donations. It is hard to tell if the average donation amount is based on relevance to the "blurb" of the Kickstarter, or if its based off tiers set by owner of Kickstarter.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another table we could add is to the Outcomes Based on Goals. I believe if we were at a graph to show success rate compared to Total number of projects it will display clearer information. That sheet also doesn't inform the user that it is based off the subcatagory "Plays", which can give further misinformation.
